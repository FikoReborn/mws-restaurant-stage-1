# Restaurant Reviews Project

## About this Project

This is the **Restaurant Reviews Project** from the Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree. With this I have converted a standard restaurant reviews webpage to be responsive across all device sizes and made it accessibility frienidly as well as implementing service workers so this can be viewed offline, as well as online.   


### Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local machine. 

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (the map will only work on port 8000 due to access restrictions I have placed on it) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and you should be good to go.
